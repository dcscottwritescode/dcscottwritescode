- 👋 Hi, I’m @dcscottwritescode
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about all kinds of things and paths in life. Writing, coding/programming, computer/tech, art, video games, music and more! I have spent a lot of my life creating art, especially music, drawings, and writing poetry/short stories. And now I am putting all those into one while adding coding to the mix to create something special one day, hopefully!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning game development in Unity using C#. I would someday like to land a job developing some aspect of video games at a studio, or work on my own games as an indie dev!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever my learning and interests end up taking me. I am excited to see what sort of projects I'll be working on as I explore and experiment 
with code uwu. Whether you're an artist, level designer, creative writer, musician, or fellow coder, it does not matter! I would love to collab with you on mine or your projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: @ dcscottwrites@gmail.com
