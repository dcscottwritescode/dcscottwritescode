- 👋 Hi, I’m @dcscottwritescode
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about all kinds of things and paths in life. Writing, coding/programming, computer/tech, art, video games, music and more!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python as well as using the Odin Project for learning web dev. I would like to land a job in development sometime in the kinda near future, but I am
not trying to rush myself.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever my learning and interests end up taking me. I am excited to see what sort of projects I'll be working on as I explore and experiment 
with code uwu.
- 📫 How to reach me: @ dcscottwrites@gmail.com
